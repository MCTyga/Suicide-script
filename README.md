# Suicide-script
What first just sounds stupid can really help people. Imagine you get stuck and try to use the console to kill yurself but many admin-mods block the kill command. If this is the cas you can you go ahead and type !suicide in the chat.

Place this file in the garrysmod/autorun/server directory and restart your server to activate it!
